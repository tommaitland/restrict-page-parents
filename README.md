Restrict Page Parents restricts page parent options to those owned by the user, with the option of forcing a page parent. Permissions can be set by role and user.

# Description

Restrict Page Parents is a lightweight plugin to enhance the user permissions features of WordPress. It changes the option to set a parent page to show only pages owned by the current user. It can also force users to select a parent page before publishing or saving.

The plugin prevents editor users from adding their own pages under sections of the WordPress website they do not own or manage. Editors can now be confined to their own section of the website, making your WordPress website much more secure.

You can set the permissions that apply to each role, or specify them on a user-by-user basis from the plugin options page.

You can find out more about the plugin [here](http://www.tommaitland.net/restrict-page-parents) or on the [Github project page](https://github.com/tommaitland/rpp).
